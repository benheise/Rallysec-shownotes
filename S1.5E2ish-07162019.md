**Title:** Media File Jacking bug allows exploit to access Telegram and WhatsApp media

**Synopsis/outline:**  
Cybersecurity company Symantec found an exploit that could allow WhatsApp and Telegram media files — from personal photos to corporate documents — to be exposed and manipulated by malicious actors. The security flaw, dubbed Media File Jacking, stems from the time lapse between when media files received through the apps are written to a disk and when they are loaded in an app’s chat user interface. Given the perception that security mechanisms like end-to-end encryption render this new generation of IM apps immune to privacy risks, this threat is especially significant.

**Title:** 2020 presidential campaigns didn't learn many lessons from 2016  
**Author:** Sergiu Gatlan  
**Author twitter:**  twitter.com/serghei  
**Reference(s):** https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/most-2020-presidential-campaign-not-using-proper-email-security/  
**Synopsis/outline:**  
2020 U.S. presidential campaigns are not using proper email security according to research from Californian-based email threat protection firm Agari. Their analysis shows that most of the political campaigns of current major party candidates for next year's U.S. presidential elections (polling at 1% or higher as per Real Clear Politics) are failing to implement proper Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) policies to protect their donors and voters from phishing attacks that could lead to fraud. Domain administrators can employ DMARC to protect the users who receive forged emails by enabling policies that will redirect them into the Junk folder (’p=quarantine’), or reject it completely (’p=reject’). For domains where DMARC is used by only the ‘p=none’ policy is enabled, the spoofed emails will go through, but the admin of the impersonated domain will also be alerted.

**Synopsis/outline:**  
American telecommunications company Sprint states in a breach notification letter sent to customers that hackers managed to infiltrate their accounts using the Samsung.com "Add A Line" website as a springboard in their attack. The U.S. telecommunications services provider — with 54.5 million customers as of March 2019 and roughly 30,000 employees — says in the letter sent to its customers that there were two breaches, one that took place on June 8 and one on June 22. "On June 22, Sprint was informed of unauthorized access to your Sprint account using your account credentials via the Samsung.com 'add a line' website," says the breach alert letter. Billing addresses, phone numbers, and names are among the personal information that the hackers could have accessed according to Sprint.

**Synopsis/outline:**  
 Apple informed us that it has sent out a silent security update to Macs to remove software that was automatically installed by RingCentral and Zhumu. These video conferencing apps both used technology from Zoom — they’re essentially white labels — and thus they also had Zoom’s security flaws. Specifically, they installed secondary pieces of software that could take commands from websites to open up your webcam in a video conference without your intervention.
