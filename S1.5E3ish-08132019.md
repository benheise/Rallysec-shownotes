A second operation appears to have been generated from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

**Title:** YouTube is diverting Zika-afflicted areas to disinformation campaigns run by the far right.

**Synopsis/outline:** The New York Times reporter Max Fisher is reporting that YouTube is diverting Zika-afflicted areas to disinformation campaigns run by the far right.
YouTube's algorithms are designed to maximize watch time and click-through rates without preference for any ideology. Videos often automatically play after each other following this algorithm, drawing people who are passively watching one video into another, potentially more popular one, with the intent of simply keeping the viewer watching.
The New York Times suggests that emotions like fear, anger, and doubt, keep people actively clicking, or being passively sent to, videos which espouse conspiracy theories or other types of provocative videos.  
The Zika-afflicted area most studied by this report is Brazil, where QUOTE "Doctor YouTube" is being used by many parents in their search for information. The problem is that the far right parties in the country have done a great job using YouTube as a platform for their messages, with major far right figures in prominent positions stating that they wouldn't be there without YouTube. According to the New York Times, YouTube is more prominent in media than all but one Television channel in Brazil.

**Title:** Russia Focused Journalists and NGOs using Proton-Mail have been SUCCESSFULLY targeted in spear phishing attacks

**Reference(s):** https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/08/10/guccifer-rising-months-long-phishing-campaign-on-protonmail-targets-dozens-of-russia-focused-journalists-and-ngos/  
**Synopsis/outline:** The attack appears to have begun in April of this year, with a number of typosquatted domain registrations. These journalists were sent emails allegedly alerting them to unauthorized access to their email accounts. Users were prompted to contact the ProtonMail support desk, with a fake support desk email.   
 
While it's clear that the unknown adversary was attempting to harvest account credentials, the complex JavaScript in the attack makes it unclear how much further damage may also have been done. We await further details from Bellingcat once the forensics are complete.

**Title:** Chinese Propaganda against Hong Kong Protesters  
**Author:** Multiple  
**Author twitter:**  
**Reference(s):** https://www.whatsonweibo.com/how-the-hong-kong-protests-are-discussed-on-chinese-social-media/  
**Synopsis/outline:** So this one requires some back story: Hong Kong remains largely independent from China as a result of a treaty signed with Britain to hand over the port city back when I was a kid. Demonstrations in Hong Kong first started in early Spring of this year against a bill that would. As protests spread, the protesters demands began including things such as greater freedom, democracy, and less meddling from China in the affairs of Hong Kong.  
Disagreements amongst the protesters make it unclear if the majority of them wish to change current government policy or throw out the officials.  
Mainland Chinese officials were largely silent on the topic. However, the Chinese top official for handling Hong Kong Affairs, Yang Guang, has condemned the actions of the protesters as having "
exceeded the boundaries of acceptable protest" calling them "radicals" who are pushing Hong Kong into a "dangerous Abyss."  
On August 6th, he warned that the protesters should not "mistake [Chinese] restraint for weakness]."  
According to multiple sources monitoring Chinese Social media, the heavily state controlled discussion, which was once silent on Hong Kong, is now trending on most major platforms. Dozens of videos allegedly show violent protestors. Whatsonweibo.com is reporting that views and evidence not supporting the government's stance are unlikely to be making it past censorship barriers. Those whose comments do make it through the censors are being marked out by other users as traitors to China.  
At present, “Protect Hong Kong, Support the Police Force” is trending on social media with the official government party pushing a hashtag which states, "[Police] Officers, We Support You."
All of this while other video appears to show a massing of Chinese vehicles at the border between mainland China and Hong Kong.
